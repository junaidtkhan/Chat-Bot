# Chat-Bot

Hi everyone!

i have made this Chat-Bot using OpenAI, React and Firebase and some other dependencies.

The front-end Library used is React. For database and Authentication FIREBASE is used. Other libraries are also used, obviously for designing and development like (BootStrap, FontAwesome, axios, opneai,firebase).. :) 

To use this application make sure to add your open_AI_Key and your Firebase project Configuration. you can insert them in two ways. 
1. Using js module
2. Inserting Directly

It's free source so feel free to use it, explore it nad modify it. 
Please just don't populate my main master Branch of git repository.
